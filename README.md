- Dynamic background changes depending on the time of day.

## Reflection

This project was filled with a lot of firsts. I had just learned about promises and how to write and use asynchronous code. Because of this, I was able to fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and use it to fill in the card I made to display the current weather. 

It was also my first time using Webpack which meant that I was able to use modules. Modules were helpful because it made the code cleaner and better organized. I was able to write functions as separate components which forced me to make think differently and create functions that didn't rely on any external values or specific DOM elements. I had to make sure that each module would accept a parameter and return something based solely on that parameter. Modules also helped me think of everything in terms of breaking down a problem into smaller components which made everything much easier to visualize and organize.
